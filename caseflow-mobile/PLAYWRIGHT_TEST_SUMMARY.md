# Playwright Test Summary for Case Assignment Flow

## Overview
This document summarizes the Playwright tests created to verify the case assignment flow in the CRM-APP mobile application. The tests validate that cases created in the web backend are properly assigned to field agents and visible in the mobile app.

## Tests Created

### 1. Simple Access Test (`simple-access.test.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Verify that the mobile app login page is accessible and functional
- **Key Verifications**:
  - Mobile app loads successfully
  - Login form elements are visible (username input, password input, submit button)
  - Form inputs are interactive

### 2. Verify Case Assignment Test (`verify-case-assignment.test.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Verify that assigned cases are displayed correctly in the mobile app
- **Key Verifications**:
  - Field agent can log in successfully
  - Assigned cases tab is accessible
  - Existing assigned cases are displayed
  - Case details can be viewed

### 3. Complete Case Assignment Flow Test (`complete-case-assignment-flow.test.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Test the end-to-end case assignment flow from API creation to mobile app display
- **Key Verifications**:
  - Admin can authenticate and create cases via API
  - Cases can be assigned to field agents
  - Field agent can log into mobile app
  - Assigned cases appear in the mobile app (with synchronization considerations)

## Test Results
All tests are passing successfully:
- ✅ Simple Access Test
- ✅ Verify Case Assignment Test
- ✅ Complete Case Assignment Flow Test

## Key Findings

### Authentication
- Field agent credentials work correctly:
  - Username: `field_agent_test`
  - Password: `password123`

### Case Assignment Verification
- Cases assigned to field agents are properly stored in the database
- The mobile app correctly displays cases assigned to the logged-in field agent
- Case details include all necessary information:
  - Customer name
  - Case status (ASSIGNED)
  - Priority level
  - Assignment to field agent

### Synchronization
- There may be a slight delay between case creation and visibility in the mobile app
- The mobile app successfully syncs with the backend to display assigned cases

## Technical Implementation Details

### React Native Web Selectors
The tests use specific selectors for React Native Web components:
- Inputs: `input[placeholder*="username"]` and `input[placeholder*="password"]`
- Buttons: `text=Sign In`
- Case elements: Various text-based locators

### Test Stability
- Tests include appropriate timeouts for element visibility
- Retry mechanisms are implemented for cases that might take time to sync
- Tests handle multiple elements with the same text using `.first()` selector

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure all CRM-APP services are running:
   - Backend API on port 3000
   - Mobile app on port 5174
2. Playwright dependencies installed

### Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
npx playwright test

# Run specific test
npx playwright test tests/simple-access.test.ts

# Run with visual output (non-headless)
npx playwright test --headed
```

## Conclusion
The Playwright tests successfully validate the case assignment flow in the CRM-APP mobile application. The tests confirm that:

1. Cases created in the web backend and assigned to field agents are properly stored
2. Field agents can log into the mobile app with their credentials
3. Assigned cases are displayed in the mobile app
4. Case details are correctly shown when viewing individual cases

The test suite provides confidence in the case assignment functionality and can be used for continuous integration and regression testing.
