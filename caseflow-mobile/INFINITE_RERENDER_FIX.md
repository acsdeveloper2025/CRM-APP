# React Infinite Re-render Fix - WebSocket Implementation

## Problem Diagnosed
The mobile app was experiencing infinite re-renders due to a cascade of function recreations in the React component tree:

```
Warning: Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component calls setState inside useEffect, but useEffect either doesn't have a dependency array, or one of the dependencies changes on every render.
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Problematic Dependency Chain**
The issue was caused by an unstable dependency chain in the useWebSocket hook:

```typescript
// PROBLEMATIC: These functions were recreated on every render
const setupEventHandlers = useCallback(() => {
  // Event handlers that called fetchCases()
}, [
  onCaseAssigned,        // ✗ Recreated every render
  onCaseStatusChanged,   // ✗ Recreated every render 
  onCasePriorityChanged, // ✗ Recreated every render
  onError,               // ✗ Recreated every render
  fetchCases,            // ✗ Despite being memoized, still triggered cascade
]);

const connect = useCallback(() => {
  // Connection logic
}, [isAuthenticated]); // ✗ This function was recreated when setupEventHandlers changed
```

### 2. **App.tsx Dependency Issue**
In App.tsx, the useEffect was including the `connectWebSocket` function in its dependency array:

```typescript
// PROBLEMATIC: connectWebSocket was recreated on every render
useEffect(() => {
  // Service initialization
  if (isAuthenticated && navigator.onLine) {
    setTimeout(() => connectWebSocket(), 5000);
  }
}, [isAuthenticated, connectWebSocket]); // ✗ connectWebSocket caused infinite re-renders
```

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Stable Callback References with useRef**
Created stable references for callback functions to prevent cascading re-renders:

```typescript
// ✅ FIXED: Stable callback references
const callbacksRef = useRef({
  onCaseAssigned,
  onCaseStatusChanged, 
  onCasePriorityChanged,
  onError,
  fetchCases,
});

// Update callbacks ref when they change (controlled update)
useEffect(() => {
  callbacksRef.current = {
    onCaseAssigned,
    onCaseStatusChanged,
    onCasePriorityChanged, 
    onError,
    fetchCases,
  };
}, [onCaseAssigned, onCaseStatusChanged, onCasePriorityChanged, onError, fetchCases]);
```

### 2. **Simplified Dependency Arrays**
Removed problematic dependencies from useCallback:

```typescript
// ✅ FIXED: Minimal, stable dependencies
const setupEventHandlers = useCallback(() => {
  const handlers: WebSocketEventHandlers = {
    onCaseAssigned: async (notification) => {
      // Use stable reference instead of direct callback
      await callbacksRef.current.fetchCases();
      callbacksRef.current.onCaseAssigned?.(notification);
    },
    // ... other handlers using callbacksRef.current
  };
}, [
  // Only include truly stable dependencies
  showCaseAssignmentNotification,
  showCaseStatusChangeNotification,
  showCasePriorityChangeNotification,
]);
```

### 3. **Removed Unstable Dependencies from App.tsx**
Fixed the App.tsx useEffect to not depend on the recreated function:

```typescript
// ✅ FIXED: Removed connectWebSocket from dependencies
useEffect(() => {
  const initializeServices = async () => {
    // ... initialization logic
    if (isAuthenticated && navigator.onLine) {
      setTimeout(() => connectWebSocket(), 5000);
    }
  };
  initializeServices();
  // Remove connectWebSocket from dependencies to prevent infinite re-renders
}, [isAuthenticated]); // ✅ Only depend on truly stable values
```

## Technical Benefits

### 1. **Performance Optimization**
- ✅ Eliminated infinite re-renders
- ✅ Reduced unnecessary function recreations
- ✅ Stable WebSocket event handlers
- ✅ Improved app responsiveness

### 2. **Memory Management**
- ✅ Prevented memory leaks from continuous re-renders
- ✅ Reduced garbage collection pressure
- ✅ Stable object references

### 3. **Offline-First Functionality Preserved**
- ✅ All offline-first WebSocket features still work
- ✅ Case assignment, submit, and sync operations functional
- ✅ Conservative connection management intact
- ✅ Battery optimization maintained

## Code Changes Summary

### Files Modified:
1. **`hooks/useWebSocket.ts`**:
   - Added stable callback references with `useRef`
   - Simplified `setupEventHandlers` dependencies
   - Used `callbacksRef.current` for event handlers

2. **`App.tsx`**:
   - Removed `connectWebSocket` from useEffect dependencies
   - Added explanatory comment about the fix

### Test Results:
```bash
✅ No compilation errors
✅ No infinite re-render warnings
✅ WebSocket functionality preserved
✅ Offline-first architecture intact
```

## Lessons Learned

### 1. **React Hook Dependencies**
- Always analyze if functions in dependency arrays are truly stable
- Use `useRef` for callback references when dealing with external callbacks
- Be cautious with functions that depend on props/state

### 2. **WebSocket + React Best Practices**
- Minimize dependencies in WebSocket-related hooks
- Use stable references for event handlers
- Separate connection logic from event handling logic

### 3. **Debugging Infinite Re-renders**
- Look for unstable dependencies in `useCallback` and `useEffect`
- Check if functions are being recreated unnecessarily
- Use React DevTools Profiler to identify problematic renders

## Prevention Strategies

1. **Stable Dependencies**: Only include truly stable values in dependency arrays
2. **Callback References**: Use `useRef` for external callback functions
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Keep connection logic separate from event handling
4. **Regular Auditing**: Periodically review hook dependencies for stability

The fix ensures the mobile app runs smoothly with the offline-first WebSocket architecture while eliminating the infinite re-render issue completely.
